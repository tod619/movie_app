# movie_app

## Description

An application that uses the moviedb third party API to retrive data and insert that data into the DOM which is then displayed back to the user. The app displays the top 20 movies from the site. The app has search bar functionality that allows a user to enter a word and it returns movie titles with that word in the title. The app gets a poster image, title, rating + description from the api.
